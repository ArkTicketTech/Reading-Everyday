Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. An army of robots is freely available —— it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. If you can't code, write  books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. There is no skill called "business". Avoid business magazines and business classes. Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.
