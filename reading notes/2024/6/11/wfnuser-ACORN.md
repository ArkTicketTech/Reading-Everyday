- ACORN
	- 核心
		- core idea is to search over the index’s predicate subgraph,
		- The core techniques we propose are predicate-agnostic neighbor-list expansions and pruning during construction in combination with predicate-based filtering during search
	- $ACORN-\gamma$
		- search
			- 和 hnsw 的主要区别在于 GET-NEIGHBORS 有两种策略
				- filter-based - 对 $N^l(v)$ 根据 p 进行过滤得到 $N^l_p(v)$
				- compression-based - 对 $N^l(v)$ 进行扩展 引入 two-hop 邻居 然后 filtering
		- construction
			- 相比于 hnsw 有两个核心改动
				- expand neighbor list
				- predicate-agnostic pruning
			- Neighbor List Expansion
				-
			- Compression
				- The core idea of the pruning procedure is to precisely retain each node’s nearby neighbors in the index, while approximating farther away neighbor during search.
