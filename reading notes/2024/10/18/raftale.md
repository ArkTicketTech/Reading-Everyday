1. Ciphers: Algorithms for encoding text to make it unreadable to voyeurs
2. Keys: Numeric parameters that change the behavior of ciphers
3. Symmetric-key cryptosystems: Algorithms that use the same key for encoding and decoding
4. Asymmetric-key cryptosystems: Algorithms that use different keys for encoding and decoding
5. Public-key cryptography: A system making it easy for millions of computers to send secret messages
6. Digital signatures: Checksums that verify that a message has not been forged or tampered with
7. Digital certificates: Identifying information, verified and signed by a trusted organization

PKI: Public-Key Infrastructure

RSA: One popular public-key cryptosystem

Digital Signatures: digest + Public-key cryptography
1. Signatures prove the author wrote the message.
