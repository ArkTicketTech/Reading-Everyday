### crypto magic

1. privately outsourcing computation
    - GGoogle can actually compute on the encrypted values without knowing what the plain texts are
2. zero knowledge(proof of knowledge)
    -  the number N was constructed is as a product of two large primes, N = P * Q, Alice know N and P and Q, Bob just know N, Alice can prove to Bob that she knows the factorization of N, but Bob absolutely learns nothing at all about the factors P and Q.
