Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich.
So , technology is the set of things that dont quite work yet  . Once something works , it's no longer technology. Society always wants new things . And if youwant to be wealthy , you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you , within your skill set , and within your capabilities.
Then you have to figure out how to scale it because if you only build one , that's not enough . You've got to build thousands , or hundreds of thousands , or millions , or billions of them so everybody can have one . Steve Jobs  figured out society would want smartphones . A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times one hundred and was easy to use . So , they figured out how to build it , and then they figured out how to scale it.
