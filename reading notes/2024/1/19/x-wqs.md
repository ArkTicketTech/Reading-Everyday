The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for 4 years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession  within nine months, and it's obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.

It's much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the right thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you're not scared of any book.
