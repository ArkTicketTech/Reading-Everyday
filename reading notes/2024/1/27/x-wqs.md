knowledge only you know or only a small set of people knows is going to come out of your passions and your bobbies, oddly enough. If you have bobbies around youyr intellectual curiosity, you're more likely to develop these passions. If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it's a distraction. Keep looking. I only really want to do things for their own sake. That is one definition of art. Whether it's business, exercise, romance, friendship, whatever, I think the meaning of life is to do things for their own sake. Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you're just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful. Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is 'hot' right now. If your curiosity ever leads you to a place where society eventually wants to go, you'll get paid extremely well.
