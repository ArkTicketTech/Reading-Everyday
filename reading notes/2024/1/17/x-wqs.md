Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet. You can go on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet. Escape competition through authenticity. The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.
