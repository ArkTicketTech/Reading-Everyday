You have to basically get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and it doesn't know how to get else where. and a lot of people think you can go to school and you can study for how to make money. but the reality is there's no skill called business. what you're actually trying to figure out is what product or service does society want but does not yet know how to get and you want to become the person who delivers that and delivers it at scale. so thats really the challenge in how to make money. and now the problem is if you can't learn how to do it then how do you become good at it whatever it is and what it is moves around generation in generation but a lot of it happens to be in technology. It's called specific knowledge that only you know. and its basically going to come out of your passions and your hobbies oddly enough. So if you have hobbies around intellectual curiosity and you're more likely to have skill sets that society does not yet know how to train other people how to do because if you can train other people how to do something then it can replace them.
