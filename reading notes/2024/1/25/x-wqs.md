It's ownership versus wage work. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but 	you're not going to make the money that give you finacial freedom. You're not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation. Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you're still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid. You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important. But usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies or even by investing. In the investment firm they are buy equity. These are the routes to wealth. It doesnt come through the hours.

追随自己真正的求知欲上下求索，而非盲目选择眼下赚钱的热门方向。
