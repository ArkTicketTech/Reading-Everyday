Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people's time. If i do my job right, if i create value for society, society says, "Oh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work you did in the past. Here's a little IOU. Let's call that money." Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that's running at night, serving other customs. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses. So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets taht can earn while you sleep. Technology democratizes consumption but consolidate production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone. Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn't yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn't need you. They would already be stamped out.
