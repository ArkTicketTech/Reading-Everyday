But the new generations fortunes are all made through code ormedia. Joe Rogan making $50 million to $100 million a year from hispodcast. You're going to have Pew Diepie. I don't know how muchmoney he's rolling in, but hes bigger than the news And of course,here's Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, BillGates, and Steve Jobs. Their wealth is all code-based leverage. Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about neworms of leverage is they are permissionless . They don't requiresomebody elses permission for you to use them or succeed . For laborleverage , somebody has to decide to follow you . For capital leverage ,somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.
 Coding , writing books , recording podcasts , tweeting , You Tubing -these kinds of things are permissionless . You dont need anyone's permission to do them , and thats why they are very egalitarian .Theyre great equalizers of leverage . Every great softwaredeveloper , for example , now has an army of robots working for him atnighttime while he or she sleeps , after they've written the code , andit's cranking away . 
You're never going to get rich renting out your time.
