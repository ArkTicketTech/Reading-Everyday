Public-key crypto based on factoring. Used for encryption & signatures

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. The encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key which is kept secret (private).

The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.
