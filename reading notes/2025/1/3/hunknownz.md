Storage is designed as a word-addressed word array. Unlike memory, storage is associated with an Ethereum account and is persisted across transactions as part of the world state.

We've been running a contract account's bytecode all this time. Only now we see the account and the world state, and it matches the code inside the EVM.

Again, itâ€™s important to note that storage is not part of the EVM itself, rather the currently executing contract account.
